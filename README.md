## Overview

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I planned to use Material Theme UI for the checkbox and todo cards but I decided to write my own components which am proud of because of the feel of the UI I built.
With state management, Redux seemed like overkill for this small app so I used the context api for managing the state of checkbox and todo components as well as the theme (dark and light) properties.
